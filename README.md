#Morphilist
## What it does
Morphilist is an app that marries sleep trackers and to-do lists to help hone user productivity expectations. 
  On the night side the user tracks: bedtime, wake time, sleep goal, sleep debt, and sleep rating based on how refreshed they felt in the morning.
  On the day side the user tracks: To dos-what was accomplished and what wasnt accomplished, caffine intake
The goal is to provide the user with a report that compares productivity to sleep paterns in the same app and help guide lifestyle changes that match the user's goal.
Reports would be generated on a week and month basis and show trends comparing sleep, stimulant use, and productivity.

## MVP
My MVP would be an app that took in when a user went to bed, when they woke up, what their goal for sleep is, and how refreshed they were.
It would also hold their tasks for the day and keep track of what was accomplished and what wasn't.
At the end of the week, it would be able to describe and visually show average sleep and sleep debt total, average amount of tasks completed vs incomplete, and corrolate those results.

## Further Goals
Above the MVP, I would like it to give suggestions to improve based on nights where the user felt most refreshed, and days when the user was most productive. 
I would like to-dos to have an excertion rating so that the app could suggest when sleep debt might be too high and the user may experience trouble accomplishing the large tasks ahead.

## Tools
I plan to write this using Python, Flask, and sqlite3 and mySQL. I may look into Flutter as well.
